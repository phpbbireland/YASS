# YASS (Yet Another Soldering Station)

Based on Stefan Wagner (wagiminator) T12 design (as I'm too old and lazy to start from scratch).
I am currently building two versions (SMD & TH) and testing will start as soon as all parts arrive.

The aim is to have a soldering station at least on a par with my KSGER (value for money, hands down the best Iron I have ever used)...
